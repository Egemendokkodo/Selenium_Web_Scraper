Does the opportunity to play a key role in the launch of a software platform with massive impact (for millions or even billions of people) excite you?  
If you‚Äôve answered with 3 resounding yeses, then we want to meet you!  
What We Expect
We are a cutting-edge web3 infrastructure scale-up project seeking a few very talented developers who are not just looking for a job but want to be challenged to accomplish great things in an exciting venture.   
We are the veterans of many successful startups and will put you on the accelerated learning curve toward your future success.  
This position requires a great understanding of large-scale distributed computing, storage, and content delivery systems and web3 technologies.  
You'll be immediately challenged to take ownership of key development track(s) within one of our innovation squads: 1. Decentralized Data Cloud Squad, 2. Blockchain Squad, 3. Tools, Services & Integrations Squad.

We require contributors to have excellent communication skills (esp. written), for everything must be well organized and tracked in Notion, Slack, Wiki‚Äôs, etc. We want autonomous, goal-oriented individuals who embrace transparency and accountability. No one wants to micro-manage others.
We need good teammates who are generally cool people who want to be part of a great team & decentralized community where everyone truly helps and challenges each other to learn/grow by innovating together towards greater shared goals. Embracing the building of such a collaborative community is the only way we can sustain rapid innovation (and the only way to live/work, really).

Understanding of blockchain network protocol development, its economics and game theory.
Academic background in consensus algorithms, decentralized and distributed systems, cryptography, or other web3-related topics.
A bit more about our Multinational, High-Performance (and primarily remote) Team Join a highly talented multicultural team that is based all over the world. We have offices in San Francisco, New York, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Berlin, and several locations in Asia. As stated above, we make remote working possible by embracing our ethos, yet many teams also travel to meet in person every 1-2 months.
